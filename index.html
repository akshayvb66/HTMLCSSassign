        he International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa.

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The ICC has a long term ambition for cricket to become the world’s favourite sport and our four year strategy that will take us through to 2019 is the first step on that journey.
                 During this period we will lead the continued drive towards more competitive, entertaining and meaningful cricket for players and fans.
                 We will grow the sport by creating more opportunities for more people and nations to enjoy it and increase the competitiveness of international cricket at all levels. 
                And finally, we will continue to make considerable efforts to protect the integrity of the sport.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                    The ICC Global Development team who are based across five continents is tasked with building a bigger, better global game by assisting the 92 Associate Members (AMs) grow and improve the standard of cricket within the different territories. The team provides global support through a number of services to the Members which can range from assistance on governance, high performance, growth of the game at grassroots level, marketing and communications expertise and how to develop commercial strategies within an organisation.
                    Over the past 20 years the amount of cricket being played in AMs has increased significantly, to the point where there are now over 1.5 million participants currently in the game of cricket, outside the Full Member nations.

            <h2>Cricket for good</h2>
            <P>
                    Amid a seemingly never-ending debate about what the spirit of cricket actually means, the one thing that is undeniable is that cricket can be a force for good and a vehicle that can be used to raise awareness of issues that might otherwise garner little or no publicity.
                    In that regard the period 2015-16 saw the ICC use its profile and the profile of its events to publicise significant subject matter that affects people way beyond the boundaries of a cricket ground.
                    Cricket For Good was created as the ICC’s global community outreach programme aimed at leveraging the vast power and reach of cricket to positively impact the lives of children and families worldwide
