            <p>It gives me immense pleasure to greet all the members of the staff, parents and students in this new academic year 2015-16 through this platform. 
                Sharpening the intellect, grooming the inherent talents and abilities yet learning to keep feet firmly rooted on the ground is something that our children learn from the elementary stage. I consider it an honour to nurture such a noble sapling to its full glory. 
          Kendriya Vidyalaya, Bijapur, is delighted to be constructing a strong link to the chain of institutions thriving under the aegis of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.
          Modern education indicate full utilisation of human potential in a disciplined way, thus providing holistic development to an individual, who continues to develop knowledge, curiosity, courage, and confidence.
                    The need of the hour is that all of us -teachers, students and parents- learn to re-evaluate, revitalise and rejuvenate to keep pace with the evolving times.</p>
